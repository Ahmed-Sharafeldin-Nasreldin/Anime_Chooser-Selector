# Anime_Chooser-Selector
## CS50P Project

Anime Details Fetcher is a Python script that fetches and displays details of anime from the Kitsu API. Users can enter anime titles or get a random suggestion, and the script will show details such as the English and Japanese titles, synopsis, rating, and episode count.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The script requires Python and the Requests library. You can install Requests using pip: pip install requests


### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the command: `python anime_details_fetcher.py`

## Usage

After running the script, follow the prompts to enter anime titles or get a random suggestion. The script will fetch and display the details of the selected anime.

## Libraries Used

- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/): A library for making HTTP requests in Python. It is used in this script to send requests to the Kitsu API.

## Features

- Fetch details of anime by entering titles.
- Get a random anime suggestion.
- Display details such as English and Japanese titles, synopsis, rating, and episode count.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Error Handling: Implement error handling to handle cases where the API request fails or the anime details are not found.
- User Interface: Consider building a graphical user interface (GUI) for the script to make it more user-friendly.
- Testing: Write unit tests to ensure the script functions correctly and handles different scenarios.
- Documentation: Provide inline comments in the code to explain the purpose of each function and section. Additionally, consider writing a more detailed documentation file (e.g., using Sphinx) to explain the project structure, usage, and any additional features.
